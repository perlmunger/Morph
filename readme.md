#Morph a Square Into A Circle With Core Animation

I created this little project to answer a question on stack overflow here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33745002/how-to-animate-changing-shape-of-a-view-in-ios-i-e-change-its-path-from-on/33746959#33746959

It demonstrates how you can take a shape with a fixed set of points in a path and automatically morph it into another shape that has the same number of points.
